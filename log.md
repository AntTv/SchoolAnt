Begin to start adding a meta tag for the password page, then proceed to program the framework for the website itself.
Once complete, try and purchase a server to run a database on the website so we can have different variations of login,
which will allow us to shorten to code and make it less likely for someone to break into the website as it is now.

Change the format of the website once complete to something more suitable. Begin working on a custom website design.
Add a programming page such as ghostbin so you can save your code locally on the website instead of having to use publishers 
like ghostbin itself. 

Add a typing test to your website so you can continuously log yourself to see progress as you continue.

Increase security measures on the website so no one can access it without having the access code.

Ask S. to see if he can program a back end to the website in which only could be accessed through IP.

This is part of the 'Security Update'.
